#This function represents the local navigation of our project : 

#Important information : sensor detect the obstacle's accurately from 3cm to 13cm ; Over 14cm it doesn't detect them anymore.
#Goal : 
#The Robot will avoid the obstacle either on the right if obstacle detected on teh right side, either on the left.
#The obstacle is assumed as passed if the absolute position of the robot is back on the track computed by 
#A* (= finite number of absolute coordinates on the official path.)
#we will implement an uncertainty of the position of 2 meshs

#Local navigation True/False (Bolean) 


#Steps: 1.sensors values as input
#       2.create a local map : plot it for tests.
#       3.2 either put the coordinates into array of vision
#       3.3 or escape on our own the obstacle
